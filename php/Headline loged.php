The X Factor may not be returning this year, but ITV boss Kevin Lygo has now suggested that it's unlikely we'll see the reality show on our TV screens again next year either.

Back in February, it was confirmed that Simon Cowell had decided to rest The X Factor in 2020, with the series taking a year off in order to "reinvigorate" the show for when it eventually returns, originally thought to be in 2021.

But at the virtual Edinburgh TV Festival this week, Lygo admitted that The X Factor isn't definitely returning next year after all.

"It's not definitely returning – it might return, and if it does the format will tweak," Lygo said (via The Sun).</p>
          <p>X Factor will not return in 2020 as Simon Cowell plans 'rest' for ITV show. The X Factor will not return later this year as Simon Cowell plans to “rest” the talent show for 12 months. The programme has been an annual staple on ITV since 2004 but will not air in 2020. Instead, there are plans to bring it back in 2021. &#8230; <a href="#">Read entire article &raquo;</a></p>

          <p>The four-time Emmy Award-winning musical competition series “The Voice” returns with the strongest vocalists from across the country to compete in the show’s newest season. Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract. &#8230; <a href="#">Read more &raquo;</a></p>
